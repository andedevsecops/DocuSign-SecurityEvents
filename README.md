# Ingest DocuSign Security Events
Author: Sreedhar Ande

DocuSign-SecurityEvents Data connector ingests security events for your DocuSign account into Azure Log Analytics Workspace using DocuSign Monitor REST API

Following are the configuration steps to deploy Data connector.

## **Pre-requisites**

Option #1
DocuSign OAuth Token is required. See the documentation to learn more about the [Obtain your OAuth token](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/jwt-get-token/).

Option #2
1. https://apiexplorer.docusign.com/
2. Authenticate using your credentials
3. Select any API end point and click on "Send Request" 
4. If you receive "Success" response - copy the Authorization Bearer token (token only without Bearer prefix)

## Configuration Steps
1. Deploy the ARM template and fill in the parameters.
	```
	"DocuSignAccessToken": This is the DocuSign OAuth Token
	"Workspace Id": Azure Log Analytics Workspace Idâ€‹
	"Workspace Key": Azure Log Analytics Workspace Key
	"CustomLogTableName": Azure Log Analytics Custom Log Table Name
	"Function Schedule": The `TimerTrigger` makes it incredibly easy to have your functions executed on a schedule
	```
2. There are two json files (ORGS.json and lastrun-Monitor.json) in Function Dependencies folder
3. Edit the ORGS.json file and update "org": "sampleorg" and replace sample org with your org name. 
	```
	If you have single org
	[
		{
			"org": "sampleorg1"
		}
	]  

	If you have multiple org's
	[
		{
			"org": "sampleorg1"
		},
		{
			"org": "sampleorg2"
		},
		{
			"org": "sampleorg3"
		}
	]
	```

4. Edit lastrun-Audit.json and update "org": "sampleorg" and replace sample org with your org name

	```
	If you have single org

	[
		{
			"org":  "sampleorg1",
			"lastRunEndCursor":  "",
			"lastRun":  ""
		}
	]  

	If you have multiple org's

	[
		{
			"org":  "sampleorg1",
			"lastRunEndCursor":  "",
			"lastRun":  ""
		},
		{
			"org":  "sampleorg2",
			"lastRunEndCursor":  "",
			"lastRun":  ""
		}
	]
	```

5. Upload the following files to the storage account "docusign-monitor" container from 
	```
	ORGS.json
	lastrun-Monitor.json
	```

6. DocuSignAccessToken and Workspace Key will be placed as "Secrets" in the Azure KeyVault `docusignkv<<uniqueid>>` with only Azure Function access policy. If you want to see/update these secrets,

	```
		a. Go to Azure KeyVault "docusignkv<<uniqueid>>"
		b. Click on "Access Policies" under Settings
		c. Click on "Add Access Policy"
			i. Configure from template : Secret Management
			ii. Key Permissions : GET, LIST, SET
			iii. Select Prinicpal : <<Your Account>>
			iv. Add
		d. Click "Save"

	```

7. The `TimerTrigger` makes it incredibly easy to have your functions executed on a schedule. This sample demonstrates a simple use case of calling your function based on your schedule provided while deploying. If you want to change
   the schedule 
   ```
   a.	Click on Function App "Configuration" under Settings 
   b.	Click on "Schedule" under "Application Settings"
   c.	Update your own schedule using cron expression.
   ```
   **Note: For a `TimerTrigger` to work, you provide a schedule in the form of a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression)(See the link for full details). A cron expression is a string with 6 separate expressions which represent a given schedule via patterns. The pattern we use to represent every 5 minutes is `0 */5 * * * *`. This, in plain text, means: "When seconds is equal to 0, minutes is divisible by 5, for any hour, day of the month, month, day of the week, or year".**

8. Once Azure Function App is deployed
	 ```
	a.	Go to `docusignevents<<uniqueid>>`
	b.	Click on "Advanced Tools" under Development Tools 
	c.	Click on Go --> You will be redirected to Web App --> Check Temp folder path. 
	d.	It can be either C:\local\Temp\ or D:\local\Temp\.
	 ```
9. After finding Temp folder path
	```
	a.	Go to `docusignevents<<uniqueid>>`
	b.	Click on "Configuration" under Settings
	c.	Click on "TMPDIR" under "Application Settings"
	d.	Update Drive (C//D) based on your findings from Step 9.
	```
	**Note: Make sure the value in "TMPDIR" doesnt have "\\" at the end.**

10.	**For Azure Gov customers only**, You will see additional environment variable "Azure Tenant" under "Configuration" --> "Application Settings" and its default value is ".us"
	Currently this Function App supports "Azure Gov(.US)" tenants
	Ex: https://portal.azure.us
